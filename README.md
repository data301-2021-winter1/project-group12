## Our topic is looking at the standings of F1 drivers since 1950. We all avidly watch formula one weekly and want to analyze multiple top drivers and the history of their standings along with their teams' over all standings. We are also intigued to look at the variance of performance between different nationalities of drivers, which could implicate stictness on perfeormance. each race has a maximum of 26 drivers. there are three rounds of qualifying, each round is between ten to twenty minutes, after each round of qualifying the five slowest cars are eliminated, and are placed at the back of the race grid. this establishes the order of the drivers for the officaial race. points are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in each race. the winner receives 25 points, the driver in second place recieves 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively. FUN FACT, brakes in an F1 car can reach 1000 degrees celcius and still work fine, which makes it all the more exciting to watch.

It includes drivers end of year position and the points earned individually in the race year. The dataset was collected to illustrate the standings for each year for the public starting in 1950 to 2020. This dataset also illustrates driver performance and allows to see how their performance was on a year-to-year basis. This allows the viewer to see the prime of the racer and the decline. The data does not include data on a team basis, it solely looks at individual placement and points. The data consists of thirty five different nationalities on one hundred ninety five race teams. Our data also contains one female driver out of the three hundred eighty eight drivers.
